# PVPC + Kasa smart plugs + Nicehash

This script calculates the cost-effectiveness of mining. It queries historical data from a *TP-Link HS110* smart plug, queries average cost/day of the electricity (Spanish grid only for now, PVPC) and also queries Nicehash's API in order to get bitcoin produced per day on my machines.

## Getting started

You can install the most recent release using pip while in the project root:

`pip install .`

Then you'll need to install its dependencies using:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Finally, run it by:

```
$ python3 pvpc-knh
Current power consumption (W): <EmeterStatus power=878.161282 voltage=236.091346 current=3.776688 total=7.551>

## Requirements and supported devices

* TP-Link Kasa smart plug, this code has been tested with the HS110
* Nicehash API private token

### Plugs

* HS100
* HS103
* HS105
* HS107
* HS110
* KP105
* KP115
* KP401

## TODO:

* We don't use 'ESIOS API' because it requires an API token, we use a web scraper on
  [https://tarifaluzhora.es/](https://tarifaluzhora.es/?tarifa=pcb&fecha=10%2F01%2F2022) instead. This is slower,
  but it is easier to set up. Will try to use ESIOS API by requesting a token on the CLI
* CLI doesn't have any parameters yet. Should have at least start_date and end_date or a default value for current month
* Nicehash API
* Tidy the code for the plot function.
